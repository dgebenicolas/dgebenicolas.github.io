<div style="text-align: justify">I loaded the data into SQL for initial processing and created data frames ready for visualizations in Python. After comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, linear relationships, feature correlation, and seasonality effects, I utilized AutoML to compare models and determine feature importance. I built and fine-tuned machine learning models, including XGBoost, to predict Walmart's weekly sales. My best model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of ** $2968.84 ** and an R-squared value of ** 0.9830 **, capturing ** 98.3% ** of the variance in the target variable. The strong performance in predicting sales underscores the model's potential as a valuable tool for inventory management and strategic decision-making in the retail industry.</div>
